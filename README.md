# Testing Journey

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate React and Node testing recipes across the front and back ends using

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
[Cypress](https://cypress.io)

Some features will be specific to next.js but the methodology behind the structure of the code and tests can be applied regardless of the framework used.

## Intro

This repo consists of 3 modules that are provided within the branches.

Each module builds on the last beginning with

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End 2 End Testing

## Tasks

You'll see a tasks folder that contains markdown files.

These files will guide you through each module as you move through the branches.

They're numbered 00 and increment as you progress.

You can read everything from the main branch or go step by step and build upon each concept.

## Getting Started

To get started, install all of the necessary modules

    yarn install

    -- or --

    npm install

Fetch all of the upstream branches

    git fetch --all

Then checkout to the first module.

    git checkout start
