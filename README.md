# React & Node Testing

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate testing recipes across the front and back ends using

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
[Cypress](https://cypress.io)

Some features will be specific to next.js but the methodology behind the structure of the code and tests can be applied regardless of the framework used.

## Getting Started

This repo consists of 3 modules that are provided within the branches.

Each module builds on the last beginning with

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End 2 End Testing
